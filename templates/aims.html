        <h2>Our Aims</h2>
        <p>To allow the analysis of chat data to be more accessible even for people without coding background.<br><br>
            We want acquaintances and project teams to know the pattern of time when someone responds to messages to be able to engage in a more prolonged conversation. This way, we hope that friendships can be closer, and efficiency can be improved in the context of project work.<br><br>
            Especially in Singapore, many have been left frustrated at undesirable chatting habits such as using excessive Singlish commands in text messages. We hope to help identify these excessively-used commands for people to identify and then make conscious effort to change these habits.<br><br>
            Additionally, we want to help couples find meaningful gifts for their partners. The aesthetically-pleasing and customizable visualisations are crafted to be presentable for occassions such as Anniversary or Valentineâ€™s. This is not only limited to couples, but friends can also gift this poster to each other in the events of Birthdays or Christmas!
