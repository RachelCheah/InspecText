Instructions to open our webpage (without the upload file feature 100% functioning):

1. Download server.py, static folder, and templates folder and make sure they are all on the same folder in your laptop.
2. Download wkhtmltopdf package here https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html. Make sure wkhtmltopdf.exe is in the same folder as files in step 1.
3. Open server.py and run code
4. In your terminal, you'll see the words "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/". This is a local host (run the code using VSCode if cannot get this step). Follow link.
5. You can now navigate through the webpage except for uploading of files (not fully functional).
