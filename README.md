Instructions to use our Jupyter Notebook:

Run the kernel in order from the top.

1. Uncomment the first kernel to install all the libraries that we used.
2. Under the 6th Kernel, insert file location of .txt file.
3. Run the 9th kernel, rename author1_name and author2_name if you want the diagram to reflect a name other than your contact name.
4. Run the rest of the code to the end and a file titled 'ChatAnalyzer.png' should appear in your file directory.


Instructions to open our webpage (without the upload file feature 100% functioning):

1. Download server.py, static folder, and templates folder and make sure they are all on the same folder in your laptop.
2. Download wkhtmltopdf package here https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html. Make sure wkhtmltopdf.exe is in the same folder as files in step 1.
3. Open server.py and run code
4. In your terminal, you'll see the words "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/". This is a local host (run the code using VSCode if cannot get this step). Follow link.
5. You can now navigate through the webpage except for uploading of files (not fully functional).
