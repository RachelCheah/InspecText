Instructions to use our Jupyter Notebook:

Run the kernel in order from the top.

1. Uncomment the first kernel to install all the libraries that we used.
2. Under the 6th Kernel, insert file location of .txt file.
3. Run the 9th kernel, rename author1_name and author2_name if you want the diagram to reflect a name other than your contact name.
4. Run the rest of the code to the end and a file titled 'ChatAnalyzer.png' should appear in your file directory.
