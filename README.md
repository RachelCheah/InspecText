Instructions to use our Jupyter Notebook:

1. Uncomment the first kernel to install all the libraries that we used.
2. Insert file location under the 6th kernel
3. Run the 9th kernel, rename author1_name and author2_name if you want the diagram to reflect a name other than your contact name.
4. Run the rest of the code to the end and a file titled 'ChatAnalyzer.png' should appear in your file directory.
